In the fall of 2019, I provided 2 weeks of guest lectures to Present and Future Climates, a joint undergraduate-graduate course. These lecutres covered Atmospheric General Circulation and Climate Variability. To view the lecture slides and notes, click the links above. Below is a detailed list of topics covered in each week.

Atmospheric General Circulation:
- Zonal-mean solar insulation
- Hot-plate circulation
- 3 cell structure of the atmosphere
- Conservation of angular momentum
- Coriolis force
- Hydrological Pattern
- 3D momentum equation
- Thermal wind balance
- Meridional energy transport
- Stationary and transient eddies
- Baroclinic instability

Climate Variability:
- Forced vs internal variability
- Teleconnections
- Variability timescales
- Walker Circulation
- El Nino Southern Oscillation
- North Atlantic Oscillation
- Southern Annular Mode
- Pacific Decadal Oscillation
- Atlantic Meridional Oscillation
- Madden-Julian Oscillation
