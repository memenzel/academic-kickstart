Hi! My name is Molly Menzel, welcome to my personal page. I study our planetâ€™s atmosphere by using both idealized and fully comprehensive climate models to better understand the dynamics involved. These models present valuable insight and allow us to further develop theory that describes past, present, and future climates. Currently, I am a doctoral student at Johns Hopkins University working with Prof. Darryn Waugh. My latest research is focused on developing a better understanding of the relationship between the subtropical jet and Hadley Cell, and how that impacts both the tropics and the midlatitudes. In addition to research, I actively seek out opportunities to teach the dynamics of our climate to students and the general public alike.
